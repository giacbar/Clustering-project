# Clustering-project
## Comparison and examples of clustering algorithms

Small project focused on the comparison of three methods for clustering, using as an example mall customer data. 
The results are present in the notebook files and a pdf presentation is available as well, with more theoretical details.

### Files included:
- Notebook files (`kmeans.ipynb`, `hierarchical.ipynb`, `dbscan.ipynb`) with the examples
- Python files containing the code (`mall analysis hierarchical`, `mall cluster analysis k means`, `mall dbscan`)
- Input file `Mall_Customers`
- Presentation in .pdf format
